                <h3> Ex-Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for nationwide protests after he was handed a
                    three-year jail sentence over corruption allegations.</h3>

                <p>Mr Khan was found guilty of not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received in office. He
                    denies the charges and says he will appeal.</p>

                <p> After the verdict, Mr Khan was taken into custody from his home in Lahore.</p>

                <p>In a pre-recorded statement posted after the verdict, he urged supporters to fight against the
                    ruling.</p>

                <p> "I have only one appeal, don't sit at home silently," he said in a video address posted to X,
                    formerly known as Twitter. "I am struggling for you and the country and your children's future," he
                    added.</p>

                <p>The former cricketer-turned-politician, 70, was elected in 2018, but was ousted in a no-confidence
                    vote last year after falling out with Pakistan's powerful military.</p>

                <p> Mr Khan is facing more than 100 cases brought against him since his removal - charges he says are
                    politically motivated.</p>

            <div class="blogcontent2">
                <p>However, the government has adamantly denied that there was any political motivation in Mr Khan's
                    arrest or disqualification. Marriyum Aurangzeb, Pakistan's minister of information and broadcasting,
                    told the BBC: "You have to be accountable for your deeds in law. This has nothing to do with
                    politics. A person who has been proven guilty by the court has to be arrested."</p>

                <p>Saturday's verdict centred on charges that Mr Khan incorrectly declared details of presents from
                    foreign dignitaries and proceeds from their alleged sale.</p>

                <p>The gifts - reported to be worth more than 140m Pakistani rupees ($635,000; Â£500,000) - included
                    Rolex watches, a ring and a pair of cuff links.</p>

                <p>"His dishonesty has been established beyond doubt," Judge Humayun Dilawar wrote in his ruling.
                    Outside the courthouse, some pro-government demonstrators chanted "your show is over Khan".</p>

                <p>Judge Dilawar said police had been instructed to arrest Mr Khan immediately. Within 15 minutes of the
                    verdict, footage began to circulate on social media showing a line of police cars and trucks taking
                    him away.</p>

                <p>Imran Khan's lawyer, Intazar Hussain Panjutha, told the BBC the trial had been conducted by "a
                    kangaroo-type court" in which "the accused was never given the opportunity to defend himself".</p>
